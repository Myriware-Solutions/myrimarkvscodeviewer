# Myrimark Help

Myrimark is the Myriware in-house markup language,
which is used for both users and developers.
It is a combination of the syntaxes and features
of Markup and LaTeX. Since the code is processed
and viewed as HTML, it also used a lot of the 
same things as CSS (for example, color names
and size measurements). Myrimark is adaptive and 
ever-changing, so this manual will make overviews
of the basic functions.

# The Basics
## Text

This section will cover the basics of Myrimark.
These are simple text features, and are very 
similar to Markup. Here are the simple text 
effects present in Myrimark. Each effect requries
an open and close set of characters, which you
can find next to their names below.

* //Italics// \// \//
* **Bold** \** \**
* __Underline__ \__ \__
* ~~Strikethrough~~ \~~ \~~

You can use these effects even inside of each 
other, and sets do not have to stay nested.
For example, you can start italics, start bold,
end italics, and then end bold.

## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are achieved by using two things, 
inside of parenthesis and brackets. The first part
is the brackets, which is the desired text to be
displayed. The second part in parenthesis is the
URL that you want to link to. So,

` If you need info, go to [Google](www.google.com)!

Makes: If you need info, go to [Google](https://www.google.com)!

NOTE: There should be no space between the bracket
and parenthesis.

## Lists

List are achieved by making an entire paragraph
start with the same character, wach on a newline.
For context, a paragraph is the unit of text between
two or more return lines. So, it there is text 
on the immediete next line, then it will be
consitered part of the same paragraph.

There are three kinds of lists: bullets, numbered,
and checked. They each are how they sound, and 
start with asterisks, hyphens, and right points,
respectfully. Here is an example:

$begin{multicol}{2}{lined}

    ` * One
` * Two
`
` - One
` - Two
`
` > One
` > Two

Makes:

* One
* Two

- One
- Two

> One
> Two

$end

## Code

If you want to be able to display something
like code, then you can use a code-paragraph.
These are obtained using bask-ticks at the 
start of each line. There is no text processing
on any line in a code-paragraph.

## Headers

Headers are used to section up a document. These
follow the same convention in Markup, that is,
using hashtags will produce a header. These
need to be in their own paragraph, or, you can
put multiple headers together in the same paragraph.
You can have up to six layers of headers, so
up to six hashtags.

NOTE: There are some commands that affect the
behavior of the Headers, such as the numbering
in this document.

# Commands

Commands are useful and allow for more than just
nice text. The previous section was modified
Markup, this section brings in LaTeX to provide
more than just text.

Commands are split up into two types: Local and 
Global. Local commands are things that affect
only the section they are in, or, they display 
something in the document. Global commands
handle more under-the-hood things, and do
not normally affect the flow of the document.
The biggest difference is that Local commands
accept input, while Gobal commands do not.

## Local Commands

Local commands follow a simple structure:

` :command_name[{param}]...

The command definition starts with a colon,
then followed by the command name, and then
any parameters inside of curly brakets.
Note there is no spaceing between any of these
elements. In this help document, you will be able
to read and learn about all the command options
availiable. Jump to Section 4.1 to find them.

## Global Commands

Global commands follow a likewise easy syntax: 

` \CommandName

Global commands are effective once they are called,
and get removed from function when they are called
again. They do not accept any inputs. Go to 
section 4.2 for Global Commands.

## Sections

The last important thing to learn about Myrimark is 
how sections work. These are groups of paragraphs
and other sections. To create one, follow the syntax below:

` $/sp/begin{type}[{params}...]
` /sp/  section stuff...
` $/sp/end

Remember, local command only work //inside//
the sections, but Global command aren't
restricted. In Section 4.3, you will find the
types you can use.

# Command and Section Reference

At this point, you have gotten through all 
the stuff you need to know to get started.
This section will describe the different
functions and section avaible.

## Local Commands

Before diving into these, it is important to 
note that there are a lot of times that
the input will say `css` something. This is 
because Myrimark outputs in HTML, meaning,
a lot of things will be configure in css.
Thus, there is also a lot of flexiblity that 
comes with this. Common types for params include:

* string: any text.
* number: a number, normally an integer unless specified.
* cssColor: Some form of css color, like `salmon` or `#FFFFFF`.
* cssSize: A size in css, such as `1em` or `15%`.

It might be helpful to look online about these different css
mesures for full understanding of how to use them.

### Background Color 

`:background_color{color:cssColor}`
Sets the background color of a section.
Note that the theme that you use
for VS Code may automatically change the 
defualt background.

`:background_color{red}
`
`This color is really cool!

$begin{paragraph}
    :background_color{red}

    This color is really cool!

$end

### Text Color

`:text_color{white:cssColor}`
Sets the color of the text.
Note that the theme for VS Code
may automatically change the text color.

`:background_color{red}
`:text_color{blue}
`
`I am blue on red!

$begin{paragraph}
    :background_color{red}
    :text_color{blue}

    I am blue on red!
$end

### Padding 

`:padding{amount:cssSize}`
Sets the padding of a section.

` :padding{1em}
`
` This is something that has padding.

$begin{paragraph}
    :padding{1em}

    This is something that has padding.

$end

### Rounding 

`:rounding{amound:cssSize}`
Sets the rounding of a section. Does not
do anything visably without setting a background 
color.

`:background_color{red}
`:rounding{1em}
`:padding{1em}
`
`A little piece of body text.

$begin{paragraph}
    :background_color{red}
    :rounding{1em}
    :padding{1em}

    A little piece of body text.
    
$end

### Image 

`:image{url:string}`
Imports an image from the specified URL.

### Horizontal Line

`:hl{?text:string}`
Creates a horizontal line. If the `?text`
parameter is set, then it will place the 
text in the middle of the line.

`:hl{A line}

:hl{A Line}

NOTE: Right now, the VS Code version
of Myrimark is not displaying the text 
that is inputted.

## Global Commands

### `\AutoIndexHeaders`

Automatically Indexes all the Headers 
in the affected zone of control.

### `\ResetHeaderIndexes`

Sets all of the Header indexes to one,
restarting the indexing count.

### `\EveryLineBreaks`

Turns the two newline required space to 
differenciate paragraphs to just one,
turning every line in the effected zone
into its wn paragraph.
