# Myrimark Help

Myrimark is the Myriware in-house markup language,
which is used for both users and developers.
It is a combination of the syntaxes and features
of Markup and LaTeX. Since the code is processed
and viewed as HTML, it also used a lot of the 
same things as CSS (for example, color names
and size measurements). Myrimark is adaptive and 
ever-changing, so this manual will make overviews
of the basic functions.

# The Basics
## Text

This section will cover the basics of Myrimark.
These are simple text features, and are very 
similar to Markup. Here are the simple text 
effects present in Myrimark. Each effect requries
an open and close set of characters, which you
can find next to their names below.

* //Italics// \// \//
* **Bold** \** \**
* __Underline__ \__ \__
* ~~Strikethrough~~ \~~ \~~

You can use these effects even inside of each 
other, and sets do not have to stay nested.
For example, you can start italics, start bold,
end italics, and then end bold.

## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are achieved by using two things, 
inside of parenthesis and brackets. The first part
is the brackets, which is the desired text to be
displayed. The second part in parenthesis is the
URL that you want to link to. So,

* If you need info, go to [Google] (www.google.com)!

Makes:

* If you need info, go to [Google](https://www.google.com)!

NOTE: There should be no space between the bracket
and parenthesis. It is there in the example because
currently, there is no way to try and represent it
without actually creating it.

## Lists

List are achieved by making an entire paragraph
start with the same character, wach on a newline.
For context, a paragraph is the unit of text between
two or more return lines. So, it there is text 
on the immediete next line, then it will be
consitered part of the same paragraph.

There are three kinds of lists: bullets, numbered,
and checked. They each are how they sound, and 
start with asterisks, hyphens, and right points,
respectfully.
