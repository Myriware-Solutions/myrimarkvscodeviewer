# Visual Studio Code Myrimark Extention

This extention supports the use of Myrimark code,
which is the [Myriware](https://myriware.space/) in-house
Markup for documentation and user text. It is more advanced
than Markdown, by implemention of assets from LaTeX and HTML.

You can find out more about Myrimark on the website, or
by accessing the VSCode command palette and activating the
Myrimark Docs Command.
